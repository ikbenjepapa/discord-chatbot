#Discord Bot: AI-Powered Chat Assistant
Overview
This Discord bot leverages OpenAI's gpt-4o-mini model to respond intelligently to user queries. Users interact with the bot by mentioning it and using the !ask command.

Features
AI-Powered Responses: Answers user queries using OpenAI's gpt-4o-mini model.
Mention-Based Activation: Processes commands only when the bot is mentioned.
Response Chunking: Handles long AI-generated responses by splitting them into chunks of up to 2,000 characters.
Custom Status: Displays a helpful status to guide users on how to interact with the bot.

#Usage
Mention the bot in a channel where it is active.
Use the !ask command followed by your query:
Example: @botname !ask What is the capital of Japan?
The bot responds with AI-generated output.

Response Handling:
Splits responses longer than 2,000 characters to comply with Discord's message limit.
Sends the response chunks sequentially.
